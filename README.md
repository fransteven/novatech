## 🛠️ Architecture Principles

- **Separation of Concerns:** Features are divided into UI (components), Server Actions (`app/actions/`), and Business Logic (`services/`).
- **Server Actions:** All mutations are handled strictly via Next.js Server Actions to minimize client-side javascript and keep the API surface secure.
- **Service Layer:** Business logic that communicates with the `db/` is isolated in the `services/` folder ensuring code reusability.
- **Type-Safe:** The entire stack ensures type-safety starting from database schemas in Drizzle, to request validation in Zod, down to frontend forms.

## 🏃 Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables:**
   Ensure you have a `.env` file configured with the required Database and Authentication variables.

3. **Run database migrations (if required):**

   ```bash
   npx drizzle-kit push
   ```

4. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
